Target. 2027-04-23. The plan was fitted to it.

Allocation. People are allocated as a percentage of their working time to this plan. By track, the allocation adds up to Workflow 100 percent, Experience 60 percent. The dates in this plan already account for it, so a track at less than 100 percent has fewer working days in each work unit.

## Milestone 1, Submit an expense report (`m1-submit-report`)

Exit gate. A staff member creates a report with a receipt in the web client and submits it through the service.

## External items and external inputs

These are owned outside the team, not by the engineers. They have no work item file. An item that needs one says "external input" in its Depends on row. If the input is missing, say so in the pull request and do not invent it.

| Id | External item | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WI-05 | Pilot team recruitment | The stakeholders name the pilot team and confirm their cost centres before work unit 4. |
| WI-10 | Finance sign-off | Finance operations approves the export format and the retention period before the release. |
